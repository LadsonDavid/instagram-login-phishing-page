# Security Notice

## Educational Purpose Only

This project is strictly for **educational purposes** to demonstrate how phishing pages work. Using this code for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical.

## What This Project Demonstrates

1. **Mimicking Legitimate Websites**: How attackers create visually identical websites to trick users.
2. **Form Data Collection**: How submitted data can be captured.
3. **Client-Side Validation Bypass**: How basic validation can be bypassed.
4. **Domain Confusion**: Reliance on visual cues rather than checking the URL.

## Legitimate Security Research

If you're using this for legitimate security research:
- Always test in an isolated environment
- Only test with explicit permission
- Never store real credentials
- Document your findings responsibly

## Protecting Yourself From Phishing

Here's how to protect yourself from real phishing attempts:

1. **Check the URL**: Always verify you're on the legitimate website before entering credentials.
2. **Look for HTTPS**: Ensure the connection is secure (though phishing sites can use HTTPS too).
3. **Be Suspicious of Emails/Messages**: Don't click links in unsolicited messages.
4. **Use Two-Factor Authentication**: This provides an extra layer of security.
5. **Use Password Managers**: These can warn you if you're not on the legitimate site.
6. **Keep Software Updated**: Updates often include security patches.

## Reporting Phishing

If you encounter a real phishing attempt:
- Report it to the impersonated organization
- Report to your email provider
- Report to anti-phishing organizations like [PhishTank](https://www.phishtank.com/)
- In the US, report to the [FTC](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/)

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Remember, creating phishing websites to harvest credentials is:
- A violation of computer crime laws in most jurisdictions
- A violation of terms of service for most web hosts
- Potentially subject to civil and criminal penalties
- Harmful to real people

## Educational Alternative

For legitimate educational purposes, consider adding a banner clearly stating it's a demo, disabling actual form submission, or using dummy data.
